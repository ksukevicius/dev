The purpose of this project is to learn, test GIT.

Let's practice to use git diff command.

first command: git init

there I'm learning to use git branch command

just adding new line here

this line only in master
this line just in br3, and there was a commit to master after br3 was created
I want to keep both lines (master and br3)
